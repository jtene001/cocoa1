<div id="r-markdown" class="section level2">
<h2>R Markdown</h2>
<p>This is an rmarkdown file, bare bones that I created to see if it posts on the blog.</p>
</div>
<div id="including-plots" class="section level2">
<h2>Including Plots</h2>
<p>You can also embed plots, for example:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/doesrmdwork_files/figure-html/pressure-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Note that the <code>echo = FALSE</code> parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.</p>
</div>
